# People Analytics

People Analytics is a data-driven approach to manage people at work by using data mining techniques to analyze data about the employees in order to make organization and employees successful. People analytics is also known as HR Analytics which improves performance through best Human Resource practices.

## About the Data
Finding data is one of the biggest challenges we faced. As no organization reveals the inside information about its workforce and their methods of working, it was hard to gather meaningful data to perform statistical analysis using data mining algorithms. So, we thought of combining two datasets. The first dataset consists of the data metrics related to employee satisfaction level, performance, salary, time spend in company, etc while the other data consists of the employee reviews such as pros, cons and advice to management for different companies on Glassdoor.
